# Breast-Cancer-Mortality-Survival-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Project
This repository contains my full machine-learning workflow for predicting breast cancer mortality and estimating survival months using the SEER dataset. The project follows the CRISP-DM methodology and includes data preprocessing, model development, optimisation, and evaluation.
